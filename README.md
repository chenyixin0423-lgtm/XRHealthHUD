XRHealthHUD

A Unity-based XR health monitoring HUD prototype.

This project implements a head-locked HUD for displaying simulated health data (heart rate and step count) in an XR environment.
The system focuses on HUD stability, motion handling, and alert feedback under head movement.

The project is developed using Unity and the XR Interaction Toolkit, with data simulated for demonstration purposes.
